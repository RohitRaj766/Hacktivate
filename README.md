# LokManch: A Digital Civic Platform for a Viksit Bharat

## 🚀 Overview
LokManch is a digital civic platform aimed at empowering citizens to actively participate in India's democratic and governance processes. Built to support the vision of a Viksit Bharat by 2047, LokManch combines technology with civic engagement, enabling transparency, inclusivity, and participative governance.
